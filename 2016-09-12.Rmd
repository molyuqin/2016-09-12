I will suggest exercises from this book each week. 

Your TA will work through some of them in tutorial each week.

## other resources

Other (free, downloadable PDF through library) similar books:

* *Introduction to Probability with Statistical Applications* by Schay (similar level)
* *An Intermediate Course in Probability* by Gut (more advanced)
* *Introduction to probability models* by S. Ross (a bit more engineer-y)

Avoid books with titles like *Introduction to Probability and Statistics For \<Some Certain Specific Type of Student or Career\>*

A very nice (free PDF through library) book for those really interested in the mathematics of all this is: *Elementary Analysis* by K. Ross. (Subtitled "The Theory of Calculus".)

Wikipedia, youtube, stackexchange, google. Lots of good stuff. Lots of bad stuff. 

# meanings of probability

## no need to write this down

* Physical, long term relative frequency, "repeated experiments", "frequentist", "propensity"

* Evidential, subjective, "Bayesian", inductive

Visit Department of Philosophy for more information.

Whatever the interpretation, the mathematical rules are the same, based on axioms that define how probabilities can be assiged to events.

# axiomatic approach to probability

## elements and sets { .small }

We can think of an element $\omega$ belonging to a set $A$. We can think of sets $A$ and $B$ along with a universal set $S$. We have the following notions, and more:

* Membership $\omega \in A$

* Union "or" $A \cup B$; Intersection "and" $A \cap B$; works for infinitely many

* Complement $A^c = \{w \in S : w \not\in A\}$

* Empty set has no elements: $\emptyset$

* Disjointness: $A \cap B = \emptyset$ (notice: not a probability concept)

* Subset: $A \subseteq B$ (and "proper subset")

* Set difference: $A\backslash B = A\cap B^c$

## sample space { .small }

Probability starts with a sample space $S$, a collection with all possible outcomes of the random process. Often cumbersome and arbitrary; mainly used this week. Examples:

* Coin toss: $\{H, T\}$

* Picking a card: $\{A\spadesuit, A\heartsuit, A\diamondsuit, A\spadesuit\}$

* Toss two coins: $\{HH, HT, TH, TT\}$. Or possibly: $\{\{H,H\}, \{H, T\}, \{T,T\}\}$

* A race among 8 horses: ?

* Toss a coin until a head appears: $\{H, TH, TTH, TTTH, \ldots\}$

* Pick a real number between 0 and 1 "uniformly": $(0, 1)$ (A "continuous" sample space.)

## event { .small }

An event is a collection of outcomes; equivalently a subset of the sample space S.

Naming conventions: Roman letter near the beginning $A,B,C,\ldots$ or $A_1,\ldots,A_n$ or $A_1, A_2, A_3,\ldots$ as required.

Many examples possible from the example sample spaces.

## it's really more complicated than that { .small }

This is an elementary course, so we will not concern ourselves with the fact that not *all* subsets of a sample space are allowed to be called "events".

Really an event has to be a "suitable" collection of outcomes. 

For finite and countable (i.e. "list-able") sample spaces, in fact *all* events are "suitable".

But not for uncountable sample spaces, such as $(0,1)$. 

The "space" of suitable events can be called $\mathcal{A}$. 

## the probability axioms

A *probability measure* is a real-valued function (usually called) $P$. Its domain is $\mathcal{A}$, a space of suitable events in $S$. In addition, it has the following properties:

1. $P(S) = 1$ 

2. $P(A) \ge 0$ for all *events* $A \in \mathcal{A}$. 

3. If $A_1, A_2, A_3,\ldots$ is a *disjoint* collection of events, then:

$$P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty P(A_i)$$

The last property is called "$\sigma-$additivity".

There is a notion of "probability triple" $(S, \mathcal{A}, P)$ when needed to be absolutly clear (which isn't often in this course.)

## the axiomatic approach

In the fussiest possible treatment, the first question is: are these axioms *consistent*, which is the same as asking "Are there any probability measures at all?"

Theorem 0: the axioms are consistent.

Proof: $\ldots$

Advanced note...when the sample space is something like $S=(0,1)$ and if we were to allow $\mathcal{A}$ to be the collection of *all* subsets of $S$, then the axioms are *inconsistent*.

## everyday properties of $P$

Continuing with total and absolute fussiness:

Theorem 1: $P(\emptyset) = 0$

Proof: $\ldots$

Theorem 2: If $A_1$ and $A_2$ are disjoint then $P(A_1 \cup A_2) = P(A_1) + P(A_2)$.

Proof: $\ldots$

Theorem 2a: If $A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_n$ are disjoint then $P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^n P(A_i)$ (called "finite additivity")

Proof: "Induction" (Note: the book lists this Theorem as an "axiom", which is not technically wrong but...)

## more everyday properties of $P$, with proofs

Theorem 3: $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$

Theorem 4: If $A \subseteq B$ then $P(A) \le P(B)$. "$P$ is monotone."

Theorem 4a: $P(B\backslash A) = P(B) - P(B \cap A^c)$

Theorem 4b: If $A \subseteq B$ then $P(B\backslash A) = P(B) - P(A)$.

Theorem 5: $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$ (and generalizations)

This is admittedly getting dull.

# a non-everyday application of this axiomatic approach to $P$

## towards showing the "continuity" of $P$ { .small }

The culmination of our axiomatic approach will be to define the notion of "continuity" for $P$ and prove that the defined property holds.

Recall from the prerequiste the notion of a *continuous* function. There are several equivalent definitions, one of which uses left- and right-continuity.

A function $f:\mathbb{R} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is left-continuous at $x$ if for any non-decreasing sequence $x_1 \le x_2 \le x_3 \le \ldots$ that converges to $x$, then $f(x_i) \rightarrow f(x)$.

(Right continuity is the same but with a non-increasing sequence.)

$f$ is continuous at $x$ if it is left- and right-continuous at $x$. 

$f$ is continuous if it is continuous at every point in its domain.

## increasing sequences of events that converge { .small }

The domain of $P$ is a collection of events $\mathcal{A}$. We need a notion of the following for events:
$$A_1, A_2,\ldots \text{ increases to } A$$

Definition: $A_n \nearrow A$ means $A_i \subseteq A_{i+1}$ and $\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i = A$

Example: Consider $S = (0,1)$. Let 
$A_n = \left(0, \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\right)$ for $n\ge 1$ and $A = \left(0, \frac{1}{2}\right)$

What about the probabilities of these events under the uniform model?

## the continuity theorem

Theorem 6 (The Continuity Theorem): If $A_n$ and $A$ are events in $\mathcal{A}$ and $A_n \nearrow A$, then $P(A_n) \longrightarrow P(A)$.

Proof: $\ldots$

This is analogous to left-continuity. There is also a right-continuity:

Corallary: Suppose $A_n$ and $A$ are events in $\mathcal{A}$ with $A_i \supseteq A_{i+1}$ and $\bigcap_{i=1}^\infty A_i = A$. Then $P(A_n) \longrightarrow P(A)$.

Proof: The Continuity Theorem, a de Morgan's Law, and "Theorem 3". 

Something to try if you like: finite additivity together with The Continuity Theorem implies $\sigma-$additivity.

## application to the continuous sample space example

Reconsider the uniform pick on $S = (0,1)$, where the probability of choosing a number in any $0 < a < b < 1$ is $b-a$. 

What is the probability of choosing exactly $\frac{1}{2}$?

Let $A$ be the event that the number chosen is *rational*. What is P(A)?

# some computations for finite and countable sample spaces

## finite and countable $S$ in general

This is hard to prove with elementary methods, but suppose:

$$\begin{align*}
S &= \{\omega_1,\ldots,\omega_n\} \qquad \text{(finite), or,}\\
S &= \{\omega_1, \omega_2, \omega_3, \ldots\} \qquad \text{(countable)}
\end{align*}$$

then a valid probability can always be based on $P(\{\omega_i\}) = p_i$ with $0 \le p_i \le 1$ and $\sum p_i = 1$.

An important special case for finite $S$ is the uniform case: $p_i = \frac{1}{n}$.

In this case many problems can be solved by counting the number of outcomes in $S$ and counting the number of outcomes in an event. 

Some people enjoy these problems. Others don't. Fortunately for you, I do not! 

## permutations and combinations

At the very least we'll need to recall (or learn!) these.

Number of ways to choose $k$ items out of $n$ where order matters:
$$_nP_k = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if k > n,}\\
\frac{n!}{(n-k)!} & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}$$

\ldots and when order doesn't matter:

$$_nC_r = {n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$

Two classic examples: "The Birthday Problem" and "Lotto"

# conditional probability

## partial information

I'll role a six-sided die. $S=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$. Consider these events:
$$\begin{align*}
A &= \{2,5\},\\
B &= \{2,4,6\},\\
C &= \{1,2\}.\end{align*}$$

So $P(A)=\frac{2}{6}=\frac{1}{3}$.

What if I peek and tell you "Actually, $B$ occurred". What is the probabality of $A$ given this partial information? It is $\frac{1}{3}$. 

I roll the die again, peek, and tell you "Actually, $C$ occurred". Now the probability of $A$ is $\frac{1}{2}$. 

Intuitively we used a "sample space restriction" approach. 

## elementary definition of conditional probability

Given $B$ with $P(B)>0$,
$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$

"The conditional probability of $A$ given $B$"

The answers for the previous example coincide with the intuitive approach.

Theorem 7: For a fixed $B$ with $P(B) > 0$, the function $P_B(A) = P(A|B)$ is a probability measure.

Proof: exercise.

## useful expressions for calculation - I

$P(A \cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$ often comes in handy. 

Consider the testing for, and prevalence of, a viral infection such as HIV.

Denote by $A$ the event "tests positive for HIV", and by $B$ the event "is HIV positive."

For the ELISA screening test, $P(A|B)$ is about 0.995. The prevalence of HIV in Canada is about $P(B) = 0.00212$. 

## useful expressions for calculation - II

Take some event $B$. The sample space can be divided in two into $B$ and $B^C$.

This is an example of a *partition* of S, which is generally a collection $B_1,B_2,\ldots$ of disjoint events such that $\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty B_i = S$.

Theorem 8: If $B_1,B_2,\ldots$ is a partition of $S$ with all $P(B_i) > 0$, then
$$P(A) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty P(A|B_i)P(B_i)$$
Proof: ...

Continuing with the HIV example, suppose we also know $P(A|B^c) = 0.005$ ("false positive").

We can now calculate $P(A)$. 

## useful expressions for calculation - III

Much to my amusement, Theorem 8 gets a grandiose title: ***"THE! LAW! OF! TOTAL! PROBABILITY!!!"***

Now, in the HIV example, we also might be interested in $P(B|A)$, the chance of an HIV+ person testing positive.

A little algebra:
$$P(B|A) = \frac{P(B\cap A)}{P(A)} = \frac{P(A|B)P(B)}{P(A|B)P(B) + P(A|B^c)P(B^c)}$$

In our example this is $\frac{0.0021094}{0.0070988} = 0.2971$.

## Bayes' rule

Theorem 9: If $B_1,B_2,\ldots$ is a partition of $S$ with all $P(B_i) > 0$, then
$$P(B_i|A) = \frac{P(A|B_i)P(B_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^\infty P(A|B_i)P(B_i)}$$
